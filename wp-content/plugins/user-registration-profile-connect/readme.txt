Profile Connect addon for User Registration

== Description ==

User Registration Profile Connect allows you to connect already registered users ( by other than user registration form ) to the user registration form so that the user/admin can later update the form fields. So, this add-on helps users to build up the profile with user registration fields even if they are registered via other means.
